(Note that these interviews were conducted separately over Zoom on Thursday afternoon, but merged below for readability. Please note: <strong>Ben <u>Winston</u> originally</strong> inaccurately stated he had spoken with Wolfgang Van Halen; he actually spoke with a rep for Wolfgang Van Halen. The quote has been corrected below. <br> Ben, how do you feel about the show, four days later? What worked, what you might have done differently?
<p> Ben Winston: I feel really good, I think whenever you’re doing a live show for that long, you are always nervous in the leadup to it, </p>
<img src="sea.jpg" width="600px;">
<p style="margin-top:40px;">no matter how much you prepare — and we prepared a lot — but when you step off the cliff on live television, you have to be ready for anything. So truthfully, the moment you go off air, it’s just a sense of relief: “We did the show we wanted to do and there weren’t any mistakes and everyone turned up” — because people say they’re gonna be there, but you never know! But I can look at that show and be proud of it from start to finish.
